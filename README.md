## About me

#### Hello, my name is Isaac Williams. Iam a second year Masters of Public Policy and Management student at Heinz.

#### I am was born in Jakarta, Indonesia. I grew up in Los Angeles, California. I did my undergrad at Howard University in Washington D.C. I also did a semester at the University of the South Pacific in Suva, Fiji and a semester long program in Amman, Jordan.  

#### I am very interested in environmental justice and it's connection to climate change and migration of people. This past summer I interned at Grounded Strategies which is a Pittsburgh non-profit that works to improve the social, economic, and environmental health of distressed and transitional communities by building capacity to reclaim vacant and underutilized land.

## What I hope to learn

#### Understanding how to ensure data or my ideas are well recieved on an online platform is something I want to develope. I want to learn to present ideas with intention. I am looking foward to having this online portfolio to apply ideas that well assist me in showcasing work.
