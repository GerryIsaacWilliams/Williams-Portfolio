## About me

#### Hello, my name is Isaac Williams. Iam a second year Masters of Public Policy and Management student at Heinz.

#### I am was born in Jakarta, Indonesia. I grew up in Los Angeles, California. I did my undergrad at Howard University in Washington D.C. I also did a semester at the University of the South Pacific in Suva, Fiji and a semester long program in Amman, Jordan.  

#### I am very interested in environmental justice and it's connection to climate change and migration of people. This past summer I interned at Grounded Strategies which is a Pittsburgh non-profit that works to improve the social, economic, and environmental health of distressed and transitional communities by building capacity to reclaim vacant and underutilized land.

## What I hope to learn

#### Understanding how to ensure data or my ideas are well recieved on an online platform is something I want to develope. I want to learn to present ideas with intention. I am looking foward to having this online portfolio to apply ideas that well assist me in showcasing work.

#### These two charts showcase the same data in different ways. The bar graph allows a clear indication of of the GDP % debt for a single year (2020). The single year paired with the single color for all data allows the reader to see that no one country is highlighted. There is also the clear indication of labels showcasing the year and GDP debt percantages without overwhelming the graph.
#### The second line graph allows for comparisons of the different countries' data over a loneger period of time. The layout of the line charts help section out the countries to showcase the differences and patterns shown by the data from different countries. There is enough space that does not allow cluttering, also clear indication of labels of the country, GDP debt percentage, and the axis labels.

#### This is a chart that I created that was similar to the line chart, but I had the shading underneath. I wanted to add the shading with a light color just to have a more clear indication of the values. I felt the line chart was good, but the lines felt harder to observe than shaded regions. They both showcase the same information of different countries with ability to compare and contrast, but countries with less data can also be seen more clear with the shaded regions.
