# Final Project

## Project Summary: 

Pacific Climate refugees (Pacific population that are displaced due to long term environmental
effects of climate change are not incorporated in international law and face legal hurdles. 
It is important to show the increased severity of the issue and to explain why proactive measures 
may are necessary but may bring beneficial aspects to host countries. 

# Outline and Initial Sketches 

## 1. Introduction

	I want to first set the stage to my project. The project focuses on Pacific Island Nations 
that are not well known to the world. It is important to set up an introduction in which a map along
with information on the people living in these islands will face in the upcoming years. Here I would 
like to add a map indicating the nations like Tuvalu, Nauru, Kiribati, and other Pacific Island Nations 
who will face environmental impact which eventually leads to displacement.

## 2. Climate Impact 
	In this section I want to include data from the United Nations Economic and Social Commission 
for Asia and the Pacific that offers an understanding of what effects are being felt in some 
vulnerable nations. Events like increased cyclones, sea level rise, flooding, drought, saltwater 
intrusion, etc. They will be presented to showcase the increased dire situation populations will face.

## Population Increase 
	This section will showcase over time the growth of population of the islands that will be severely 
affected. I think this will add context in why proactive measures will help save more lives than 
waiting until the population has ballooned and are in the middle of the final stages of climate 
displacing entire island populations.
