# Part III Final Project
## Parts I, II, and III 

[Final Project Part I](finalproject.md/)

## Part II Audience Feedback:
### Target Audience:
My target audience is those policy makers such as individuals in the United Nations, but it also extends to a general audience. The call to action specifically describes a 
recommendation that needs to be made on an international organization level as well as links to different ways to learn and support Climate Refugees.
 
My approach of finding individuals for audience feedback comes from looking for undergraduate and graduate students with some background in learning about the environment, 
digital design, and general political interest/human justice. 

## Audience Questions:

What is this site stating, what is the gist of the site?

How did you feel reading through the site?

What did you like about the design? And did not like?

What did not make sense?

What stood out to you?
 
## User Research and Interviews

Person J:
This presentation describes the issues in the Pacific Islands. Climate change causes environmental events that cause people to flee their homes. 
I felt sad that so many people will suffer from the rise of climate change.
I liked how there were a lot of comparisons. 
I was confused by the population graph comparison. The Y axis scale made it that larger nations skewed how smaller nations looked. While smaller nations had significant population increase, it was overshadowed by the larger nations.
The graphs about how many households are affected by effects of climate change like floods, drought, and others.

Person W:
It explains the rise of climate change and its impact on populations in countries in the Pacific Islands. 
The website made me feel calm because of the blue colors and smooth images.
I liked the overall project, but I think the style does not reflect the direness of the situation. 
I did not understand who the audience was. It seemed it was targeted to policy makers but I would assume that they know a lot about the issues at hand. It seemed too general for policy makers, but great for those who are like me who are new to this.
The photos and the colors associated with the project.

Person T:
It shows how the world does not have a plan for people whose homes and lands will be destroyed by the effects of climate change.
I felt neutral
I liked the facts and figures that showed the extent of the problem.
 I did not understand the population figure. It did not seem to add any information.
The photos stood out to me and also the fact that whole populated islands might be underwater soon.

Person A:
The website you shared explains the tough situation people in the Pacific Islands are facing because of extreme climate change. 
There was a sense of shock that these people will face issues like this.  
The flow worked for me because it showed the issue, how the issue will grow, then how to solve it.
I wish there was a clearer indication that refugees don’t include those affected by climate earlier on. The last slide presents that information, but I would like to see it earlier.
The photos were great! They really added to the website.

Person TD:
Climate change and how it will cause mass migrations.
The color scheme gave me a calm feeling.
I liked how you leave readers with a way to learn more about the issues in the Pacific Islands since many people are unaware of the effects of climate change there. 
I did not like how some of the information like the population graph was individual instead of percent change. 
The urban part did not make sense, but after I read more I saw how it can affect changes in population as newer migration before international one.
The colors and photos gave me a calm feeling, but I felt the information was very scary. The two did not seem to match.


## What I gathered from interviews and changes that will be made:

People generally understand the point of the wireframe. 

People are not feeling the seriousness of the information due to the colors and how the information was presented. 

Those interviewed seemed to like most of the information, but the population graph kept being stated as information they identified as not making much sense.

Redoing the population graph to present population change can allow for better country to country comparisons.

I aslo need to add more to the color scheme to make it seems that it is very important but also very scary/dire situation. I need to make an emphasis that people’s lives are at risk

I also need to add more information about how Climate Refugees are not legally recognized as refugees due to the UN definition of a Refugee.
